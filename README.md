# Credit Card Validator Using C++

This program is a simple credit card validator written in C++. It uses the Luhn algorithm to check whether a credit card number is valid or not. Additionally, it can read a CSV file to validate multiple credit card numbers in bulk.

## ⛩️ Luhn Algorithm
The Luhn algorithm, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm, is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers. The algorithm works by calculating the sum of the digits in the number, and then applying a mathematical formula to determine whether the result is a multiple of 10. If the result is a multiple of 10, then the number is considered valid.



## ⛩️ Features
🔶Validates credit card numbers using the Luhn
